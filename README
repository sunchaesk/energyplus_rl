# TODOLIST
- [X] fix action_space DONE
- [X] figure out the obs NOW
- [X] combine the same type of obs to a single variable
- [ ] calculate PMV, maybe use in the future for multi objective reinforcement learning
- [X] DONE determine heating
- [X] send observations for thermal comfort reward calculation
- [?] find how to fetch air velocity for PMV/PPD calculation
- [X] TODO: upload energyplus and start porting to google colab
- [X] github issue about premature ending if simulation not annual
- [X]  change base.py so the simulation is only for 6/21->8/21
- [X] make it so that if reward==0, then skip the NN computation
- [X] updated low_obs, high_obs vectors
- [X] test discrete action_spcae
- [X] update continuous action_space
- [?] (base_cont, base_discrete) -> (base, base_cont, base_discrete)
- [ ] continual learning feature (NOTE: controller that tracks ram)
- [ ] model save
- [ ] fix base_cont action space
- [X] fix run period
- [X] check warming days same results 
- [ ] exogeneous states
- [X] benchmarking -> algo not trained properly
- [ ] implement PPO, (maybe DDPG?)
